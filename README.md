AiWallet - AI-Powered Crypto Wallet
AiWallet is the world's first fully AI-integrated cryptocurrency wallet built for NEAR Protocol. It's not just a wallet - it's your personal crypto assistant.

Key Features
AI Assistant:
In AiWallet, you can give commands in natural language. For example, simply type "Send 50 NEAR to Alice" or "Find the best staking validator" and the AI understands and executes it. Before every transaction, AI checks risk levels, optimizes gas fees, and recommends the best timing.
Complete Wallet Functions: 
 Send/Receive: Send and receive cryptocurrency with QR codes
Swap: Token swapping through Ref Finance integration
Staking: Earn 10% APY with top validators
Bridge: Cross-chain transfers to Ethereum, Aurora and other networks via Rainbow Bridge
Analytics: Portfolio analysis and performance tracking
Smart AI Features:
AI analyzes your portfolio and suggests the best investment strategies. For example, it gives concrete recommendations like "Stake 60%, put 40% in liquidity pools." If you're trying to send funds to an unknown address, AI warns you and suggests sending a test amount first.

Technologies
The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, and Vite. TailwindCSS is used for design. NEAR blockchain integration is implemented through near-api-js and Wallet Selector. For AI, OpenAI, Groq, or Anthropic APIs are used, but importantly - users provide their own API keys, which guarantees privacy.
DeFi integrations: Ref Finance (for swaps), Meta Pool (liquid staking), Rainbow Bridge (cross-chain transfers).

Privacy and Security
AiWallet is a non-custodial wallet - your keys stay with you only. We never see your seed phrase or private keys. AI integration is also privacy-focused - you provide your own API key and all AI requests go directly from your browser to the AI provider, not through our servers.
All code is open source and anyone can audit it. You can export your portfolio or migrate to another wallet at any time.

Use Cases
For Beginners:
If you ask "How can I earn with my NEAR?" the AI explains staking, finds the best validators, and guides you through the process step-by-step.
For Traders:
Say "Swap 100 NEAR to USDC" and AI finds the best rate, prepares the transaction, and waits for your confirmation.
For DeFi Users:
AI analyzes your portfolio and suggests optimal yield strategies across different protocols. For example, it might recommend staking a portion, putting some in liquidity pools, and keeping the rest liquid for new opportunities.

Why AiWallet?
Traditional wallets are complex, technical, and error-prone. AiWallet solves this with AI assistance. You don't need deep crypto knowledge - just ask in plain language and AI executes. It warns you when gas fees are high, stops you from sending to wrong addresses, and finds the best investment opportunities.
This is the first AI-native crypto wallet. This is how working with cryptocurrency should be in the future - through simple conversation.
